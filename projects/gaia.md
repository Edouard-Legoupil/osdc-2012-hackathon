Gaia
==============================================================

Gaia is the front-end project of B2G.  It is designed as a phone.
But, it also run as a stand-alone desktop application.  You can start
your hack on the desktop, and upload it to the device when you get
one.

I will arrange some one to help hackers to build their copy of b2g
run-time for desktop, and provide a 30 mins of introduction to start
your first hack with gaia.
